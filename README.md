The place to discuss and vote on Kusama and Polkadot governance.

Polkassembly is a platform for anyone to discover and participate in Polkadot and Kusama governance. You can browse proposals made on chain, discuss with the community and vote directly from the website using a browser extension. Proposal authors are the only one able to edit the proposal post and description. You don't have to, but adding an email may help to recover your account, also you can get notifications for discussions of interest or when a new proposal appears on-chain.

This repo hosts 
- next.js app: the next js fullstack app.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
